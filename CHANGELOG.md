# Changelog

Python (`cosens-sdk` on PyPI) and TypeScript (`cosens-sdk` on npm) are versioned separately.

## Python 0.5.0 / TypeScript 0.6.0

### Breaking

- The provider-specific model client factory and its base URL constant were removed from both SDKs. Build a standard OpenAI client for your model gateway and pass it to `cosens(...)`.
- The `auto` decision defaults changed: 5-second timeout (was 60), 64 output tokens (was uncapped in Python, 256 in TypeScript), and no retries.
- The wait helpers (`wait_workflow_job`, `wait_learning`, `waitWorkflowJob`) raise `RSICandidateFailed` / `RSICandidateFailedError` when a Recipe candidate failed, instead of returning it.
- Injected Recipe/Memory context is plain text bounded by `max_context_chars` / `maxContextChars` (default 4000), not the raw JSON bundle. Evidence references and Memory scores are no longer sent to the model. Nothing is injected when there is no matched Recipe and no Memory.

### Added

- `decision_client` / `decisionClient` and `decision_extra_body` / `decisionExtraBody` for the decision and Recipe-match calls, e.g. to disable reasoning with `{"enable_thinking": False}`.
- `max_context_chars` / `maxContextChars` on `cosens(...)` and the task workflow runners.
- `RSICandidateFailed` (Python) / `RSICandidateFailedError` (TypeScript) with `code`, `phase`, `retryable`, `upstream_status`, `upstream_code`, `candidate_id` and `request_id`, read from the service's `error_detail`.
- Successful responses expose `x-request-id` as `.request_id` (Python) / non-enumerable `requestId` (TypeScript).
- `key` is optional on `start_recipe_candidate` / `startRecipeCandidate`; the default is derived from the task, revision and completion budget, identically in both SDKs.

### Fixed

- TypeScript: a declined (`activate: false` or `mode: 'disable'`) turn no longer lists Recipes, runs the Recipe-match model call or injects context (Python fixed this in 1baf0ef).
- An empty Recipe list is cached for 60 seconds and skips the Recipe-match call; candidate details are fetched concurrently; the matcher receives only title, when and when_not.
